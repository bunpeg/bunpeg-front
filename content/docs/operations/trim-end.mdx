title: Trim end
---

Cut a segment from the end of a video. I'm not sure yet if this is very helpful, but it seemed so to me.
I know this operation can be replicated with the `/trim`, but it seemed a bit harder that way.

```http
POST /trim-end
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "fileId": "string",
  "duration": number, // time lapse to remove
  "outputFormat": "mp4" | "mkv" | "webm" | "mov" | "avi"
}
```

### Technical Details:
- Swaps the files
- Automatically calculates total duration
- Uses FFmpeg's copy codec
- Throws error if resulting video would be empty
