title: Resize

Resize a video to different a size, even though the numbers used are the same as the resolution
this does not improve the resolution, so scaling a small res video will result in a bigger, pixelated video.

```http
POST /resize-video
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "fileId": "string",
  "width": number,
  "height": number,
  "outputFormat": "mp4" | "mkv" | "webm" | "mov" | "avi"
}
```

### Technical Details:
- Swaps the files
- Uses FFmpeg's scale filter
- Maintains aspect ratio
- Output is encoded with libx264 codec
