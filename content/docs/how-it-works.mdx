### The basics
Right now the service has no authentication of any kind (it's a priority for me), but besides that, it works
pretty similar to other services you might have encountered. You can upload a file, up to 500MB for now, for which
you will get a file id in the form of a nanoid.

After this you can call the operation endpoints to schedule operations to be performed on said file.
It currently has a limited set of operations, but I'm working to expand it.
You can also chain operations by using the `/chain` endpoint.
