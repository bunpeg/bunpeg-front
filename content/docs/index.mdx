description: A service to run FFmpeg commands via http
---

### Introduction
Bunpeg is a service that allows you to run FFmpeg commands via http. The idea came from me trying to run FFmpeg on a
Next.js project and failing miserably (skill issue Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯). So I decided to build a server that did it for
me, and moving forward I could focus on building UIs which is what I like the most. However, this ended up being a
fun project, forcing me to recall the little I knew about writing servers and to learn new stuff.

I will continue to improve the server to add more operations and better configurations, if you have suggestions,
write an issue, or better yet, a pull request.

Anyway, thanks for stoping by! ðŸ‘‹

### Note on AI
Bunpeg doesn't have any AI features yet. I am thinking of a few ways to help you perform operations better,
but that's for down the line, for now I want to focus on the operations. That being said, I know AI is everywhere,
so I made it easier to feed these docs to your AI of choice.

If you go to [/llm.txt](/llm.txt) you'll get the content of all the pages in one place. Also, if you only want to feed
them one page, add **.mdx** to the url and you'll get the content as text.
