As I've saif before the service is quite simple and limited as it stands, I plan to add more customisation
options for the tasks as well as better error handling and login, here's a list of them (I might've missed some):

- allow users to specify codecs on operations
- log the duration fo each operation
- (I forgot as I was writing ðŸ˜…, I'll update the list when I remember... if you have suggestions, create an issue on GH)
