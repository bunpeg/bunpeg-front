title: Best practices
---

1. Always check the file status after initiating an operation
2. Use the chain operation when possible for multiple transformations to reduce network round-trips
3. Delete files after use to free up storage
4. Monitor file sizes to stay within the 500MB limit
5. Choose appropriate output formats based on your needs:
  - MP4: Best for web playback and compatibility
  - WebM: Best for web with VP8/VP9 codec
  - MKV: Best for quality preservation
  - AVI: Legacy format, limited codec support
6. For audio operations:
  - Use AAC for best compatibility
  - Use Opus for best quality/size ratio
  - Use FLAC for lossless quality
7. For video operations:
  - Use copy codec when possible for faster processing
  - Consider resolution and bitrate for optimal quality
  - Use appropriate container format for your target platform
