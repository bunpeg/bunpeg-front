# bunpeg

Bunpeg is a service for performing FFmpeg operations via HTTP. You can upload media files (video or audio), run FFmpeg commands on them, and download the results. This service is built with [Bun](https://bun.sh).

I ended up building it because I needed a way to run FFmpeg serverless and I coun't make it work with Next.js or React, all of this for another side project :) .

PS: This is the first time I work with FFmpeg, so commands need a lot of tweaking.

## Features
- Upload video or audio files
- Trim, transcode, or extract audio from media
- Chain multiple FFmpeg operations in a single request
- Download original or processed files
- Check the status of processing tasks

You can use the [playground](https://bunpeg.io/playground) to see it in action.
